# IPC Logging

IPC Logging is a project that aims to implement a logging mechanism using inter-process communication (IPC) in the context of design patterns.

## Introduction
In this project, we explore the use of design patterns to implement a logging mechanism that allows communication between different processes. The goal is to provide a flexible and efficient way to log messages across multiple processes in a distributed system.

## Installation
To use this project, follow these steps:

- Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Usage
To use the IPC Logging library in your own project, follow these steps:

1. Import the library into your code: `const ipcLogging = require('ipc-logging');`
2. Initialize the logger: `const logger = new ipcLogging.Logger();`
3. Log messages using the logger: `logger.log('This is a log message.');`
